  <h1>Contract</h1>
  <p>I, Erica, understand that I will be given my own personal website.</p>
  <p>I understand that anything I post on this site can be accessed and seen on any computer connected to the World Wide Web.</p>
  <p>While in this class I will use the web responsibly. Anything I post on my site will contain only content appropriate for the L-S Web Server.</p>
  <p>No profanity, explicit material, material related to drugs or alcohol, or hateful content will ever appear on my L-S website.</p>
  <p>The content of my page will not be plagiarized. Any content taken from another digital or non-digital source and used in my website will be</p>
  <p>directly and clearly attributed to the source within the text of any webpage in which the content appears.</p>
  <p>My ability to abide by this contract will be partially reflected in my Web Publishing course grade.</p>
  <p>I understand that any breach of this contract may have disciplinary ramifications.</p>
